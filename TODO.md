# Add Scroll Animations to Sections

## Pending Tasks
- [x] Modify TestimonialsSection.tsx to use useScrollAnimation and apply conditional classes for smooth fade-in and slide-up entry
- [x] Modify CallToActionSection.tsx to enhance existing animations with scroll-based triggers (replace static animate-slide-in-up with scroll-triggered, add to partnership CTA and contact info)
- [x] Modify Footer.tsx to add scroll animations to the main footer content
- [ ] Ensure transitions are smooth and consistent across all sections (using Tailwind classes: transition-all duration-1000 ease-out with opacity and translate-y transforms)
- [ ] Test the animations by scrolling to each section
